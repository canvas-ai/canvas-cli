Clean up old GitHub releases while keeping the most recent ones.

$(highlight "USAGE:")
    $0 [OPTIONS]

$(highlight "OPTIONS:")
    -k, --keep N           Number of releases to keep (default: 5)
    -d, --dry-run          Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
    -a, --all              Delete ALL releases (dangerous!)
    -p, --prerelease-only  Only delete pre-releases (alpha, beta, rc)
    -h, --help             Show this help message

$(highlight "EXAMPLES:")
    # Keep only last 5 releases (default)
    $0

    # Keep only last 3 releases
    $0 --keep 3

    # Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
    $0 --dry-run

    # Keep 10 releases, dry run
    $0 --keep 10 --dry-run

    # Delete only pre-releases, keep all stable releases
    $0 --prerelease-only

    # Delete ALL releases (be very careful!)
    $0 --all --dry-run  # Check first
    $0 --all            # Actually delete

$(highlight "REQUIREMENTS:")
    - GitHub CLI (gh) must be installed and authenticated
    - jq command-line JSON processor

$(highlight "SAFETY:")
    - Always run with --dry-run first to see what would be deleted
    - Pre-releases are identified by containing: alpha, beta, rc, dev
    - The script sorts by creation date (newest first)
